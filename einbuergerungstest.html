        <h1>Privacy Policy for Einbürgerungstest:Deutschland</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Einbürgerungstest:Deutschland ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application includes:</p>
        
        <h3>2.1. Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Personally identifiable information, such as your email address, name, or other similar data, may be collected if you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., when contacting support or purchasing an app, if applicable). We generally do not require extensive personal data for the core functionality of the app.</p>

        <h3>2.2. Purchase Information</h3>
        <p>If you choose to make In-App Purchases, such as "Remove Ads," we use a third-party service, RevenueCat, to manage these purchases. RevenueCat may collect information necessary to process your transactions, which is governed by RevenueCat's privacy policy. We receive information from RevenueCat regarding your purchase status and entitlements (e.g., whether you have purchased an ad-free version).</p>
        <p>We also store a record of your purchase status (e.g., if ads have been removed) and the relevant product identifier locally on your device using AsyncStorage to ensure the app reflects your purchases correctly. This locally stored information includes whether a purchase was made and the product ID.</p>
        <p>Payment processing for In-App Purchases is handled by the respective app stores (Apple App Store or Google Play Store) and RevenueCat. We do not collect or store your credit card details.</p>

        <h3>2.3. Usage Data and Analytics</h3>

This data is primarily used for improving the Application, troubleshooting, and understanding user engagement.</p>

        <h3>2.4. Device Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect information about your mobile device, such as your mobile device ID (if applicable and permitted), model, manufacturer, and operating system version. This information is used for optimizing the Application for your device and for analytics.</p>
